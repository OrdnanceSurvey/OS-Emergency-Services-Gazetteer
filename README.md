# OS-Emergency-Services-Gazetteer

This repo contains some useful code snippets and associated details for the Emergency Services Gazetteer.

OS Emergency Services Gazetteer (OS ESG) is a single centralised source of critical information that allows first responders to precisely identify locations when the need is greatest.  

OS ESG was developed in collaboration with invaluable feedback from the Emergency Services. It provides enhanced data, such as road and motorway junctions, that improves incident response, incident reporting and situational awareness. 

OS ESG offers a national view for Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland). It is published in the AddressBase Premium format and aligns fully with requirements provided through user engagement.
